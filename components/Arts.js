      The term ‘domestic abuse’ is tightly wrapped in a layer of misconceptions
      and misunderstandings: widespread inaccurate beliefs about what abuse
      looks like, and what a victim looks like, extend not only to the general
      public, but also exist within essential services, including the police
      service. This article aims to unravel some deeply-ingrained
      misconceptions, and investigate how such unfounded societal assumptions
      may impact the reporting of domestic abuse crimes.
    </p>
    <p className={classes.text}>
      Reporting to the police is the first step in the process of convicting
      perpetrators of domestic abuse. However, only around a fifth of people who
      experience domestic abuse report it to the police. Understanding why so
      many people who experience domestic abuse do not report it to the police
      is absolutely essential for effectively protecting victims. It is also
      crucial to making successful reforms to our justice system: perpetrators
      who are not reported are able to continue being abusive, and may never be
      held accountable for their actions.

    <h3 className={classes.subheader}>What is domestic abuse?</h3>
    <p className={classes.text}>
      Domestic abuse is a serious criminal issue which is predicted to affect
      around 21% of people in the UK at some point in their lives. Below is the
      Crown Prosecution Service definition of domestic abuse:
    </p>
    <KeyPoint
      quote={true}
      text={
        '"Any incident of controlling, coercive or threatening behaviour, violence or abuse between those aged 16 or over who are or have been intimate partners or family members, regardless of their gender or sexuality."'
      }
    />
    <p className={classes.text}>
      This definition is used throughout the government, including by the police
      service and during the prosecution of perpetrators process. Currently,
      there is no statutory definition of domestic abuse, though this is due to
      change later in 2020.
    </p>
    <p className={classes.text}>
      A common misconception is that domestic abuse only refers to physically
      violent behaviour, however, ‘non-physical forms of abuse can be as
      destructive as physical violence’ - as you can see, the above government
      definition also includes multiple other forms of coercive behaviour.
      Assumptions that domestic abuse means physical abuse can be damaging to
      victims of non-physical violence, who can as a result of misconceptions be
      taken less seriously by family, friends, or even potentially by law
      enforcement. For a simple breakdown of the common myths about domestic
      abuse, please read Women’s Aid informative page.

      Why don’t people experiencing domestic abuse report it to the police?
    </h3>
    <p className={classes.text}>
      In order to successfully address the issues around reporting domestic
      abuse to the police, we must first consider the widely-held assumption
      that it is easy to leave an abusive relationship. Believing that victims
      could leave any time they want implies that victims are choosing to stay
      in an abusive relationship on their own free will - this is
      victim-blaming, because it suggests people could in some way be
      responsible for being victims of abuse.
    </p>
    <p className={classes.text}>
      According to investigations by SafeLives, high-risk victims live with
      domestic abuse for an average of 2.3 years before getting help. Here are
      some potential reasons why victims may not leave an abusive relationship
      (click the links to find out more detailed information): fears for safety;
      embarrassment: feeling isolated, financial dependence, immigration
      concerns.
    </p>
    <p className={classes.text}>
      Domestic abuse is a crime behind closed doors, and some victims may never
      reach out for help from charities or family and friends, let alone report
      it to the police. Victims can often be ad perpetrators of abuse are
      typically incredibly manipulative and blame their own victims for their
      hideous actions. Victims may feel ashamed and not reach out for help,
      Please keep in mind when looking at the data below that domestic abuse
      data is unlikely to accurately reflect exact figures about domestic abuse.

      Considering the difficulties which result in survivors staying in abusive
      relationship, it’s clear that reaching out the police to seek help and
      report abuse is not a simple task: as Sian Hawkins of Women’s Aid says,
      ‘it takes a lot of strength for a survivor to build up the courage to
      report domestic abuse to the police.’ Survey data from the 2018 CSEW and a
      2014 HMIC investigation provide an insight into the reasons why survivors
      are not comfortable to report to the police:
    </p>
    <p className={classes.text}>
      Lack of trust in police is listed as the third highest reason for not
      reporting domestic violence in both surveys. Further, in the CSEW survey,
      out of thirteen reasons for not reporting to the police, eight involved
      some element of direct concern about the police and judicial system.

      The 2014 HMIC investigation revealed that the police response was ‘not
      good enough and must be improved’ - surveyed victims said ‘that they were
      frequently not taken seriously, that they felt judged and that some
      officers demonstrated a considerable lack of empathy and understanding.’
      An updated 2019 HMIC investigation suggests victims’ confidence in police
      taking domestic abuse seriously has grown in the past five years, police
      training in understanding domestic abuse is being prioritised, and that
      police work in successful tandem with domestic abuse organisations is
      increasing, for example, by use of Independent Domestic Violence Advisors
      (IDVAS), who can effectively support victims through the judicial process.
      These are promising improvements, however, there is still a long way to go
      in terms of police improvement. For example, only 4 out of 43 police
      services in England and Wales say they have enough IDVAS to support
      victims.

      We must recognise that widespread myths about domestic abuse are not only
      found in the general public, but also exist within the police force and
      other professional services who interact with domestic abuse victims. We
      must also acknowledge the incredibly distressing issue of police
      corruption and victims who are abused by people who work within the police
      force, which needs urgent attention.
    </p>
    <p className={classes.text}>
      Victims of abuse are choosing to stay silent out of what may well be a
      well-founded fear that the police service do not always have a thorough
      understanding of domestic abuse issues, or, worse, have incorrect
      preconceived notions about abuse and are unable to sensitively address
      this issue.
    </p>
    <p className={classes.text}>
      I would like to underline one other essential factor regarding domestic
      abuse underreporting to police: shame. This is a complex issue but one
      which clearly resonates for victims of domestic abuse - it is listed as a
      key reason for not reporting to the police by both the CSEW 2018 and HMIC
      2014 survey data above. Embarrassment and blame for victims may be found
      both at home, as domestic abusers can typically use shame to manipulate
      victims into believing they are
